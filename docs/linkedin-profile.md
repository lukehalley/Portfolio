## Gap Analysis: LinkedIn vs Other Profiles

| Aspect | LinkedIn | GitHub | Reality |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Title/Bio** | "Working In The Application Team @ MinRes Perth" | "Internet Of Things" | Senior Cloud/DevOps Engineer |
| **Location** | Kings Park, Western Australia | WIT (Waterford, Ireland) | Perth → Sydney, Australia |
| **Company** | Mineral Resources Limited | "BSc (Hons) - IOT" | Mineral Resources |
| **About Section** | ✅ Updated and professional | ❌ None | Needs profile README |
| **Experience** | ✅ Complete and current | N/A | Well documented |
| **Certifications** | ⚠️ AWS cert expired (Oct 2023) | Not shown | Needs renewal |

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate
- [ ] **Renew AWS Certification** - Expired Oct 2023, needs updating
- [ ] **Update headline** - Consider "Senior Cloud/DevOps Engineer | AWS | Terraform | Azure DevOps"
- [ ] **Update location** - If relocating to Sydney, update when appropriate

### Consistency Updates
- [ ] Align GitHub profile to match LinkedIn's professional tone
- [ ] Use same professional photo across platforms
- [ ] Ensure bio/about sections convey similar messaging

### Content
- [ ] Add more recent posts about DevOps/Cloud topics
- [ ] Consider writing articles to build thought leadership
- [ ] Update Featured section with current achievements

### Cleanup
- [ ] Review and update skills list for relevance
- [ ] Update any outdated certifications
- [ ] Consider removing/updating old student-era entries (WIT student role under Experience seems redundant with Education)

- ✅ Current job title and company
- ✅ Updated location (Perth, Australia)
- ✅ Professional About section

- ✅ Featured posts highlighting achievements
- ⚠️ AWS certification expired (minor issue)

**The LinkedIn profile can serve as the reference for updating GitHub and other profiles.**
